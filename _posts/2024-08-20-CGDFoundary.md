<h2><ins>The Module and Tools</ins></h2>
Commercial Games Development included a set of three team projects, with a retro demake and a grander cohort project at its start and end. This introduced heavy usage of GitHub if it wasn't already used before, especially with the latter project mentioned due to the much larger scale.

<h2><ins>The Project/Contributions</ins></h2>
The middle project was a set of three minigames playable on a large screen display, centered around and developed in UWE's "Foundry" facility for programming events. Due to this format, each minigame was allocated equal space on the screen with specific touch controls required for each.
