## About Zachary Horton
I am a graduate from UWE Bristol, with a 2:1 in BSc Games Technology and a Merit in MSc Commercial Games Development. I specialise in Unity though I am open to and wish to learn many more engines. I am heavily passionate about player controls/mechanics and level design specifically, especially in the context of 2D platformers. This passion has fueled many of my academic and extracurricular projects, also being developed to new heights as a result of them.

### Work Experience
 The masters course also provided industry-esque experience and projects through PlayWest, with both courses giving many invaluable experiences to further affirm my aspirations and encourage me to try areas outside of my comfort. This has led me to become an extremely ambitious, hard-working and creative individual that strives to put their best into any task. I have never relented even when faced with difficult tasks, driving and pushing myself far beyond expected limits resulting in a fierce determination. 
 
 Alongside my academic work, I partook in a client position for Oakrot Games where full teamwork was essential, especially in impromptu situations. Working with another associate and Louis Morel developed my teamwork abilities exponentially, adeptly tending to Louis' needs and wishes for how his projects were to be. The most notable of these are "SUN-RISE.exe" and "Kube Kreatures", where I contributed to such areas as level design, story and dialogue scenes, mechanics, and implementing Louis' audiovisual assets alongside polishing, tinkering and bug fixing the projects to ensure they ran without any issue.
 
 As Louis liked to contribute and alter things despite lack of coding knowledge, premade engines in Unity were used as the primary foundations for projects which allowed me to adapt to their existing codebases. Consequently, I also provided troubleshooting and any other vital areas of help, especially at the end of projects including “SUN-RISE.exe” where he would become extremely stressed. Additionally, we had weekly update calls where he discussed his creative ideas alongside giving feedback to refine features further, keeping good and flexible communication with him.
    

 ### Interest in the industry
 
 I have loved the gaming industry from a young age and am incredibly keen to make experiences similar to those I've enjoyed over the years, especially through my current independent projects. Titles especially from the Super Nintendo era and many platformers have shaped my tastes, and give me plenty of ideas to pull inspiration from in my own works! As of current I am working from a prototype platforming foundation created during my time with the masters course, and am planning to make a casual couch multiplayer experience with fast-paced gameplay.
 
 As many of my favourite titles have been from the Mario series, I have also taken to designing levels in the "Super Mario Bros. X" engine, which has not only proven to be a fun learning experience in many ways but has also continued to build upon the foundations of my level designing knowledge in order to provide engaging levels oriented around the games' mechanics and various abilities. These levels have been planned out physically beforehand, then afterwards being implemented in the engine where various tweaks can be made to refine the level. 
 
 Overall each project has taught me new things while sharpening my skills still, and they will continue to as they develop. They have also provided many opportunities to fully apply play and design theory alongside player psychology, which I have been very fond of.
 
I also have a notable fondness of discovering new things to quench my interests, not only assisting with my passion for the game industry but also with things outside of such! These have included biking, VHS tape collecting and even coffee making alongside cooking itself. As shown in Kube Kreatures, I additionally have a notable passion for character and dialogue writing, 


### Very Strong Areas with Very Shorter Not Paragraphs:

	- Level Design and theory alongside how they intertwine with game mechanics, including player psychology, flow and reward	
	- Unity and C# (Notably 1 year of industry-esque experience through the Masters course and PlayWest, and 1.5 years of client position work through Oakrot Games)
	- Problem solving, applied to many areas across the board such as level design, potential game elements and coding itself
